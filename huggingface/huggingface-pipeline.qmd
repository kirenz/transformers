# Introduction

## Basics

![](https://huggingface.co/front/assets/huggingface_logo-noborder.svg)

- *Hugging Face* `Pipelines` cover common machine learning tasks

- Pre-built, easy-to-use abstractions (almost no code necessary)

- Simplify workflow

## Installation

- You need Anaconda or Miniconda

- Go to this [GitHub-repo](https://github.com/kirenz/environments) 

- Install virtual environment `env-transformers.yml`

## Python setup

```{python}
from transformers import pipeline
```


# Sentiment analysis


## Intuition

![](images/text-classification.png)

- Text classification: assigning a label or class to a given text

- Sentiment analysis is the automated process of tagging data according to their sentiment:
  - Positive, negative and neutral


## Use Cases

- Sentiment Analysis on Customer Reviews

- You can track the sentiments of your customers from the product reviews using sentiment analysis models. 

- This can help understand churn and retention by grouping reviews by sentiment, to later analyze the text and make strategic decisions based on this knowledge.


## Pipeline example with default model

```{python}
# | code-line-numbers: "|1|3|4|6"

sentiment_pipeline = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

data = ["I love you",
        "I hate you"]

sentiment_pipeline(data)

```

- Output:

. . . 

```{bash}
[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998656511306763},
 {'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9991129040718079}]
```


## Pipeline example with specific model

```{python}

specific_model = pipeline(
    model="finiteautomata/bertweet-base-sentiment-analysis")

specific_model(data)

```

- Output:

. . . 

```{bash}
[{'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.9916695356369019},
 {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.9806600213050842}]
```

## Available models {.smaller}

- Sentiment analysis models on the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-classification&sort=downloads&search=sentiment)


- *Twitter-roberta-base-sentiment* is a roBERTa model trained on ~58M tweets and fine-tuned for sentiment analysis. Fine-tuning is the process of taking a pre-trained large language model (e.g. roBERTa in this case) and then tweaking it with additional training data to make it perform a second similar task (e.g. sentiment analysis).

- *Bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment* is a model fine-tuned for sentiment analysis on product reviews in six languages: English, Dutch, German, French, Spanish and Italian.

- *Distilbert-base-uncased-emotion* is a model fine-tuned for detecting emotions in texts, including sadness, joy, love, anger, fear and surprise.

# Named Entity Recognition (NER)


## Question-answering

## Translation

## Summarization

## Text generation

## Token classification

# Creating a Pipeline

## Import

- Import the pipeline module

. . .

```{python}
```

- Create a pipeline() and specify an inference task:

. . .

```{python}

generator = pipeline(task="automatic-speech-recognition")

```

## Using a Pipeline

- Pass your input text to the pipeline():


```{python}
generator(
    "https://github.com/kirenz/transformers/raw/main/huggingface/sound/mlk.flac")

```

## Customizing Pipelines

- Change model or tokenizer


```{python}
AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification

model_name = 'distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english'
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)

custom_pipeline = pipeline(
    'sentiment-analysis', tokenizer=tokenizer, model=model)

```

## Conclusion

- Streamlined NLP workflows

- Easy integration with models

- Customizable for specific tasks
