# Sentiment analysis


## Intuition

![](images/text-classification.png)

- Text classification: assigning a label or class to a given text

- Sentiment analysis is the automated process of tagging data according to their sentiment:
  - Positive, negative and neutral


## Use Cases

- Sentiment Analysis on Customer Reviews

- You can track the sentiments of your customers from the product reviews using sentiment analysis models. 

- This can help understand churn and retention by grouping reviews by sentiment, to later analyze the text and make strategic decisions based on this knowledge.


## Pipeline example with default model

```{python}
# | code-line-numbers: "|1|3|4|6"

sentiment_pipeline = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

data = ["I love you",
        "I hate you"]

sentiment_pipeline(data)

```

- Output:

. . . 

```{bash}
[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998656511306763},
 {'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9991129040718079}]
```


## Pipeline example with specific model

```{python}

specific_model = pipeline(
    model="finiteautomata/bertweet-base-sentiment-analysis")

specific_model(data)

```

- Output:

. . . 

```{bash}
[{'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.9916695356369019},
 {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.9806600213050842}]
```

## Available models {.smaller}

- Sentiment analysis models on the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-classification&sort=downloads&search=sentiment)


- *Twitter-roberta-base-sentiment* is a roBERTa model trained on ~58M tweets and fine-tuned for sentiment analysis. Fine-tuning is the process of taking a pre-trained large language model (e.g. roBERTa in this case) and then tweaking it with additional training data to make it perform a second similar task (e.g. sentiment analysis).

- *Bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment* is a model fine-tuned for sentiment analysis on product reviews in six languages: English, Dutch, German, French, Spanish and Italian.

- *Distilbert-base-uncased-emotion* is a model fine-tuned for detecting emotions in texts, including sadness, joy, love, anger, fear and surprise.

# Question-answering

The follwoing content is based on the [Hugging Face documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/question_answering)

## Intuition

- Question answering tasks return an answer given a question. 


## Two common types

- *Extractive*: selecting an answer directly from the original text


- *Abstractive*: involves generating a new answer that may not be directly present in the text

## Log into Hugging Face

- Login to your Hugging Face account so you can upload and share your model. 

- When prompted, enter your token to login (`from huggingface_hub import notebook_login`)

```{python}

notebook_login()

```

## Example data

- Start by loading a subset of the SQuAD dataset^[Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable.]

. . .

```{python}

squad = load_dataset("squad", split="train[:5000]")

```

## Train test split

```{python}

squad = squad.train_test_split(test_size=0.2)

```


## Take a look at the data

```{python}
squad["train"][0]
```


- Output: 
. . .


```{bash}
{'id': '56cece5caab44d1400b88a9f',
 'title': '2008_Sichuan_earthquake',
 'context': 'The Red Cross Society of China flew 557 tents and 2,500 quilts valued at 788,000 yuan (US$113,000) to Wenchuan County. The Amity Foundation already began relief work in the region and has earmarked US$143,000 for disaster relief. The Sichuan Ministry of Civil Affairs said that they have provided 30,000 tents for those left homeless.',
 'question': 'How many tents did the Sichuan Ministry provide for the homeless?',
 'answers': {'text': ['30,000'], 'answer_start': [297]}}

```

## Take a look at the data


There are several fields here:

- *answers*: the starting location of the answer token and the answer text.

- *context*: background information from which the model needs to extract the answer.

- *question*: the question a model should answer.


## Tokenization

- Load a DistilBERT tokenizer to process the question and context fields (`from transformers import AutoTokenizer`)

```{python}
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
```


## Preprocessing steps


- If context exceeds the maximum input length of the model:
  -  Truncate only the context by setting `truncation="only_second"`

- Map the start and end positions of the answer to the original context by `setting return_offset_mapping=True`.

- With the mapping you can find the start and end tokens of the answer. Use the `sequence_ids` method to find which part of the offset corresponds to the question and which corresponds to the context.

Here is how you can create a function to truncate and map the start and end tokens of the answer to the context:

## Define preprocessing function 

```{python}


def preprocess_function(examples):
    questions = [q.strip() for q in examples["question"]]
    inputs = tokenizer(
        questions,
        examples["context"],
        max_length=384,
        truncation="only_second",
        return_offsets_mapping=True,
        padding="max_length",
    )

    offset_mapping = inputs.pop("offset_mapping")
    answers = examples["answers"]
    start_positions = []
    end_positions = []

    for i, offset in enumerate(offset_mapping):
        answer = answers[i]
        start_char = answer["answer_start"][0]
        end_char = answer["answer_start"][0] + len(answer["text"][0])
        sequence_ids = inputs.sequence_ids(i)

        # Find the start and end of the context
        idx = 0
        while sequence_ids[idx] != 1:
            idx += 1
        context_start = idx
        while sequence_ids[idx] == 1:
            idx += 1
        context_end = idx - 1

        # If the answer is not fully inside the context, label it (0, 0)
        if offset[context_start][0] > end_char or offset[context_end][1] < start_char:
            start_positions.append(0)
            end_positions.append(0)
        else:
            # Otherwise it's the start and end token positions
            idx = context_start
            while idx <= context_end and offset[idx][0] <= start_char:
                idx += 1
            start_positions.append(idx - 1)

            idx = context_end
            while idx >= context_start and offset[idx][1] >= end_char:
                idx -= 1
            end_positions.append(idx + 1)

    inputs["start_positions"] = start_positions
    inputs["end_positions"] = end_positions
    return inputs


```


## Apply preprocessing function 

To apply the preprocessing function over the entire dataset, use  Datasets map function.

```{python}
tokenized_squad = squad.map(
    preprocess_function, batched=True, remove_columns=squad["train"].column_names)
```

## Create a batch

- Create a batch of examples using DefaultDataCollator (`from transformers import DefaultDataCollator`) 

```{python}

data_collator = DefaultDataCollator(return_tensors="tf")

```

## Finetune the model in TensorFlow

- Setting up an optimizer function, learning rate schedule, and some training hyperparameters (`from transformers import create_optimizer`):

. . .

```{python}

batch_size = 16
num_epochs = 2
total_train_steps = (len(tokenized_squad["train"]) // batch_size) * num_epochs
optimizer, schedule = create_optimizer(
    init_lr=2e-5,
    num_warmup_steps=0,
    num_train_steps=total_train_steps,
)

```

##

Then you can load DistilBERT with TFAutoModelForQuestionAnswering:

xyz .from_pretrained hinzugefügt???

```{python}

model = TFAutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(
    "distilbert-base-uncased")

```

## Convert dataset

- Convert datasets to the tf.data.Dataset format with prepare_tf_dataset():

. . .

```{python}
tf_train_set = model.prepare_tf_dataset(
    tokenized_squad["train"],
    shuffle=True,
    batch_size=16,
    collate_fn=data_collator,
)

tf_validation_set = model.prepare_tf_dataset(
    tokenized_squad["test"],
    shuffle=False,
    batch_size=16,
    collate_fn=data_collator,
)
```

## Compile

Configure the model for training with compile (import tensorflow as tf):


```{python}

model.compile(optimizer=optimizer)

```

## Push model to the hub

- You first need to install an open source Git extension for versioning large files: <https://git-lfs.com/>

- Provide a way to push your model to the Hub (`from transformers.keras_callbacks import PushToHubCallback
`)


```{python}

callback = PushToHubCallback(
    output_dir="qa_model_poc",
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
)

```


## Start training

- Start training your model! 

- Call fit with your training and validation datasets, the number of epochs, and your callback to finetune the model:

```{python}

model.fit(x=tf_train_set, validation_data=tf_validation_set, epochs=3)

# callbacks=[callback])


```


## Evaluation

- Evaluation for question answering requires a significant amount of postprocessing. 

- This guide skips the evaluation step. The Trainer still calculates the evaluation loss during training so you’re not completely in the dark about your model’s performance.

## Inference

- Great, now that you’ve finetuned a model, you can use it for inference!

- Come up with a question and some context you’d like the model to predict:

```{python}

question = "How many programming languages does BLOOM support?"
context = "BLOOM has 176 billion parameters and can generate text in 46 languages natural languages and 13 programming languages."

```

##

The simplest way to try out your finetuned model for inference is to use it in a pipeline(). Instantiate a pipeline for question answering with your model, and pass your text to it:

```{python}

question_answerer = pipeline("question-answering", model="my_awesome_qa_model")
question_answerer(question=question, context=context)

```

##

You can also manually replicate the results of the pipeline if you’d like (`from transformers import AutoTokenizer`):

```{python}

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("my_awesome_qa_model")
inputs = tokenizer(question, text, return_tensors="tf")

```


##

Pass your inputs to the model and return the logits:

from transformers import TFAutoModelForQuestionAnswering

```{python}

model = TFAutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("my_awesome_qa_model")
outputs = model(**inputs)

```

Get the highest probability from the model output for the start and end positions:




## Translation

## Summarization

## Text generation

## Token classification

# Creating a Pipeline

## Import

- Import the pipeline module

. . .

```{python}
```

- Create a pipeline() and specify an inference task:

. . .

```{python}

generator = pipeline(task="automatic-speech-recognition")

```




## Using a Pipeline

- Pass your input text to the pipeline():


```{python}
generator(
    "https://github.com/kirenz/transformers/raw/main/huggingface/sound/mlk.flac")

```

## Customizing Pipelines

- Change model or tokenizer


```{python}
AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification

model_name = 'distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english'
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)

custom_pipeline = pipeline(
    'sentiment-analysis', tokenizer=tokenizer, model=model)

```

## Conclusion

- Streamlined NLP workflows

- Easy integration with models

- Customizable for specific tasks
