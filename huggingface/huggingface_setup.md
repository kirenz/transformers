# Huggingface Setup

If you want to use the Hugging Face API to access pre-trained models and tokenizers, you'll need to follow these general steps.

## Create account and API key

- Create a Hugging Face account if you don't already have one. You can create an account for free on the [Hugging Face website](https://huggingface.co/).

- Log in to your Hugging Face account and navigate to your profile page. Click on the "Settings" button in the top right corner of the page.

- Scroll down to the "API keys" section of the settings page and click on the "Create new API key" button. Give your new API key a name and click on the "Create" button.

- Copy your new API key to your clipboard. This key is a long string of random characters and is used to authenticate your requests to the Hugging Face API.


## Store your API key

- We define our API key as a variable in a separate Python file so we can import it into the main script. 

- Create a separate Python file called `config.py` and define your API key as a variable:

```python
API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'
```

- Save and close the file.
